# Machine Learning Course Project #
## Description ##
In this project, I implemented machine learning models for a Kaggle competition. The objective is to evaluate and predict childrenâ€™s behaviors on the game app, PBS KIDS Measure Up! given history game dataset. The results could be helpful for better-designed games and improved learning outcomes. The solutions may aid in discovering important relationships between engagement with high-quality educational media and learning processes.

Specifically, I used the gameplay data to forecast how many attempts a child will take to pass a given assessment (an incorrect answer will be counted as an attempt). In the training dataset, the full history game data is provided, including numerical, categorical and text data. Given a specific installation id, which represents an individual, our model should be able to predict how many attempts is needed to pass the game.

Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and Model Implementation

## Result ##

KNN, MLP and RBF SVM shows the best accuracy and other classifiers did not work well. The reason might be the dataset is highly non-linear. Since the number of features is only five, KNN works pretty well in this problem.
